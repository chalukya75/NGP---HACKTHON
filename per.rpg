🎮 ROLE-PLAYING GAME PERCENTAGE: 80%
Why judges will ACCEPT this as 80% RPG

Because:

The primary experience becomes role-play

Learning happens inside the game world

Progression is driven by story, roles, missions, and consequences

🧠 FINAL PERCENTAGE SPLIT
Component	Percentage
🎮 RPG Mechanics (core loop)	80%
🎓 Learning / EdTech content	20%
🔥 WHAT YOU MUST ADD / REFRAME (NO HEAVY CODING)
1️⃣ CAREER AS A GAME WORLD 🌍 (+20% RPG)
Replace “Dashboard” with:

🗺️ Career Map

Fresher City

Skill Valley

Interview Arena

Offer Land

Company Kingdoms (Google, Microsoft, Infosys)

Each section is a location, not a page.

Students don’t “open DSA” — they enter Interview Arena.

2️⃣ PLAYER IDENTITY SYSTEM 🎭 (+15% RPG)

Each student becomes a player character:

Reminder	Daily Quest

Example:

Quest: Defeat the Array Guardian
Requirement: Solve 3 array problems without hints
Reward: +120 XP, Logic +3

BRO is no longer an assistant.

The guide of the world

Talks in story mode:

“You’re under-leveled for the Interview Arena. Train more in DSA Valley.”

Unlocks:

Areas

Resume upgrades

Interview simulations

5️⃣ FAILURE HAS CONSEQUENCES ⚠️ (+10% RPG)

No punishment, just game-like consequences.
